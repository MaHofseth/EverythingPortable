# EverythingPortable

release v4 yay

allows downloading binaries from my repositories (all things ive released)

allows removing binaries

all binaries can coexist in harmony

all binaries are now easier to use

binaries now have options to download needed .dll files (specificly for obs portable and cemu portable)

now includes downloader option in all my other projects

Known Issues:

Example:

version.txt isnt read from suite (easy fix)

Just Update From Within The App (Minus The Suite)

Updating Binaries From Within The Suite Is Removed For Now Due To Its Bugginess Suite Now Updates Itself And Downloads Binaries But Binaries Must Update Themselves

Notes: DLL's Included With OBS & Cemu Are 64-Bit (OS Checker Will Be Added In A Future Update)
