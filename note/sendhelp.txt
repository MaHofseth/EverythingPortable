@<begin input code>@ #<begin choice response># $<begin command>$

input.txt to be read in. (i need to figure out how to start and stop reading at a certain symbol)
@d@ #Open In Browser# $start https://twitter.com/Lileaves/status/857465113363664896$

    @echo off
    Color 0A
    cls
    setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
    
    :: read in input and set @ as start reading into a temp variable and set variable to %<input code>% with value of <begin command> i know how to read a line into a variable so i basically want to read all this from a variable %line%
    
    :: this portion will be handled each time the interpreter goes through a line of text
    echo %<input code>%. #<choice response>#
    
    set /p choice="choice: "
    if "%choice%"=="<input code>" then !%choice%!

example variable:
"%d%" == "start https://twitter.com/Lileaves/status/857465113363664896"
"%message%" == "Open In Browser"

displayed output:
d. Open In Browser

message will be a temp variable as it will be read in as the menu progresses through each line of text

i know i can make new lines but i need someway for my interpreter to tell between display code and menu code
